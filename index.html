              </h1>
			  <p>Over the last couple of months I have felt like my life has been a hurricane. Everything is changing around me and although I have a general idea of where I am headed, its really hard to say where I am going to hit land. However, just like a hurricane, I (eye) at the the center have stayed constant. Starting a website/blog is something I have wanted to do for a while. Having taken the first step which I hope is actually the hardest and if not that, the longest; I am excited to share some of my life with you. </p>
