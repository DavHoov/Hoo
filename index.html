		<p1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Davis Hoover and I have recently been looking for an outlet to expand my design experience among other things. One of my new years resolutions this year has been “food”. I’ve wrapped couple different goals under “food” including being conscious about my diet and learning how to cook. Over my last year at Gonzaga, I have been incredibly inspired to live a healthier lifestyle in an attempt to develop a new normal for myself. I felt improving my diet is a crucial step in becoming the person I want to be. After all, you are what you eat. Obviously food is an extremely large part of everyone’s life so learning more about food has helped me to learn more about myself and others. 
			<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something else that is an extremely large part of our society is the internet, so I felt developing a website would help me to learn more about – just kidding. I just thought it would be a fun project.  Welcome to my website. Feel free to follow along on my quest for self-discovery, empowerment and self-improvement which will lead me to a New Normal.
